      <p>So yes, this is the something that I've been talking about recently. This is basically a task consultant marketplace where you can find perfect task consultant to help you doing your homework or task. We decided to call it Tugasify, which in indonesia "Tugas" simply means task. </p>
      <p>I am not alone, I will be with three of my friends to create Tugasify. Today is our first meeting regarding this project. We discussed about the website model plus the technology stack that we will probably be using. Actually I can't share much about this project yet since it's still under the development process.</p>
      <p>I have a hope to make this profitable at the end of this year. But I don't know whether or not this will succeed. I know that this is not gonna be easy, but I like to challenge my self and see how far I can push my limit. Even if we fail, we at least learn something new. I mean we're still young, it's alright to failing. Just try it again by doing it with fewer errors and mistakes</p>
